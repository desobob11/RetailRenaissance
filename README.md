## About The Project

This application was developed as a course project for a database course during my time at the University of Calgary. Retail Renaissance is comprised of a **Node.js** server that communicates with a **MySQL** database, and a **React.js** frontend.

By interacting with the web application, users trigger stored procedures in the **MySQL** database in real time! Business users can view trending products, manage inventory volumes, manage customer profiles, and order shipments to desired store branches.

## Getting Started

The repository comes with two compiled executables:
* **Main.exe** is a Windows executable compiled for x86_64 architecture. If your PC satisfies this requirement, run this executable!
* **Main** is a Mac executable compiled for Intel's x86_64 chips. If your Mac satisfies this requirement, run this executable!
* Compilation details can be found below

### Prerequisites

* <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/"> SDL2 </a> (the required binaries and DLLs are included in the repo)
* GCC, or on Windows, <a href="https://cygwin.com/"> Cygwin with mingw-64 is preferred </a>

### Installation

This section is for compiling the program.

**Windows**
1. The **make.bat** can be used to compile your program using GCC, ocne your Cygwin installation has been configured.
2. The template assumes that SDLDoom is installed in your C: directory. If this is not the case, please update any paths!
3. The script will create the **Main.exe** executable.

**Mac/Linux**
1. A makefile has been included in the repo! Please execute if you would like to recompile the program.
